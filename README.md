2. `cd slim`
3. `premake5 gmake2`
4. `make slim configuration=Debug && bin/Debug/slim`

## Resources & Inspiration

This project is immensely inspired by [The Cherno's Game Engine Series](https://thecherno.com/engine) on YouTube and [Jason Gregory's Game Engine Architecture](https://www.gameenginebook.com/) book.
